# CreditScoreCheck
This is a project realized to fullfil a company assessment test. 
I tried to use the MVVM pattern to structure the app, and for ViewModel/View comunication I used both Closures binding (ui elements mapping) and Protocol/Delegate pattern (error displaying). The app actually only fetches mock data from an endpoint and displays them.
